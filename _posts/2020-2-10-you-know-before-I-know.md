Last weekend performance-artist Arthur van Beek and the musicians Jochem van Tol and Lui Mottes performed You Know Before I Know at [The Performance Show](https://artrotterdam.com/2019/11/10/the-performance-show-avl-mundo-atelier-van-lieshout-2/), a new initiative from [Art Rotterdam](https://artrotterdam.com) which offered visitors a varied and continuous program from Friday through Sunday at a stone’s throw from the fair: in the industrial setting of [AVL Mundo/Atelier Van Lieshout](https://www.avlmundo.org).

For this project I have provided conceptual feedback, written the curatorial texts and requested successfully the project funding.

You Know Before I Know is a multidisciplinary performance in which elements of theatre, music, design and fine arts come together. Artist Arthur van Beek is interested in the tension between power and vulnerability. His performances often take place in the public sphere where he makes contact with passengers, treating them as his audience as well as participants of his performances. He moves between the extremes of power and vulnerability by making use of archetypes (such as the lonely hero or cowboy) in combination with elements of his own identity and personal history (which is marked by stuttering and dyslexia). Together they expand, contrast and question identities in a playful manner together with the audience. 

For the performance You Know Before I Know, Van Beek collaborated with artists [Job Wouters](http://www.letman.com), [Ank Daamen](http://www.ankdaamen.com), the musical duo [Soon](https://soonmusic.nl) which exists of [Jochem van Tol](https://jochemvantol.nl) and Liú Mottes, playwright Jappe Groenendijk and stylist [Maarten Spruyt](https://www.maartenspruyt.com). Together they developed a theatrical piece for the Performance Show at Art Rotterdam, where the audience is invited on stage (or backstage) for a multisensory experience. 

You Know Before I Know is presented and supported by Sociëteit Sexyland situated in Amsterdam. Every day Sociëteit Sexyland has a different owner. The owner of the day decides what kind of club they want it to be, which can vary from art exhibitions to sporting events, from gangster rap nights to dinners in stroboscopic light. Sexyland is a tabula rasa that can be written in any way possible. In their own words: “We want to highlight every unknown corner of Amsterdam, to broadcast the huge diversity this city has to offer. Every day is a new day at Sexyland”.  

This project could be realized with the generous support of [Society Sexyland](http://www.sexyland.amsterdam/amsterdam/), [Mondriaan Fund](https://www.mondriaanfonds.nl/en/) and [Amarte Fonds](https://www.amarte.nl).
