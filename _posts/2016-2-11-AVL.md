As part of Art Rotterdam, Eveline curated the show [Fertile](https://www.academia.edu/24680747/Through_The_Eye_of_Splitlazation) by Belgium artist [Anthony Nestel](https://www.amsterdamsfondsvoordekunst.nl/fondsinitiatieven/3package-deal/3package-deal-lichting-2016/anthony-nestel/) at foundation [AVL-Mundo](https://avlmundo.org), an initiative of Atelier van Lieshout. Eveline and Nestel have worked together for years, building a deep understanding of each other’s working methods. This understanding ensured enormous freedom for both of them during installation of Nestel’s work at Art Rotterdam. 

As part of the exhibition Eveline wrote [an eponymous text](https://www.academia.edu/24680747/Through_The_Eye_of_Splitlazation). The exhibition drew on mechanisms of affect. The publication did not intend to explain or illustrate how the viewer should move her/his eyes through the exhibition, but rather proposed a way for viewers to interact with the topics addressed in Fertile. The exhibition was in itself a proposal to repeat and to form alliances, to start a dialogue and to go beyond singularity.
