I have worked extensively with artist Anthony Nestel and choreographer [Esther Arribas](https://estherarribas.com) to create the conceptual framework for the performance ‘The Seafroth Knows Neither Pain nor Time’. I have shared my expertise on postcolonial theory for the conceptual framework of this art performance and worked together with them on the visualisation of the project. 

This performance has been exhibited at [Parkstad Limburg, Helen](https://www.plt.nl) (NL) 2019, [Minshar For Arts, Tel Aviv](https://www.minshar.org.il/english/) (IL) 2018, [Flam festival](https://www.flam.online/) (NL) 2017, [Relationscape, Préavis de Désorde Urban](https://redplexus.org/en/2019/06/21/preavis-de-desordre-urbain-10-2/) (FR) 2017, [Galeria Vermelho](https://www.galeriavermelho.com.br/) (BR) 2017, [de Ateliers](https://www.de-ateliers.nl/) (NL) 2017, theatre [Frascati](https://www.frascatitheater.nl/?language=en) (NL) 2017, and [Arti and Amicitae](https://www.arti.nl/) (NL) 2017.
