In 2017 Eveline has worked extensively with the [Transgender Network of the Netherlands](https://www.transgendernetwerk.nl) to create and structure a conceptual framework for the first transgender visibility day in Rotterdam, sponsored by TNN. The Dutch art magazine [Tubelight](https://www.tubelight.nl) asked Eveline during that time to edit the [102th edition](https://www.tubelight.nl/issue/tl-102/) and include one of her writings related to this topic.

The edition focused on hapticity as a visual strategy, and on how this strategy can be used by the viewer to view art that focuses on transgender discourse. The edition included an interview of artist [Chris Rijksen](https://prinschristel.com/contact/ ) by [Jessica Gysel](https://www.glumagazine.com/about/) (Girls Like Us), a review of the solo show by artist Evelyn Taocheng Wang and of a ‘tactile’ exhibition at the [Textile Museum in Tilburg (NL)](https://www.textielmuseum.nl/en/). The edition also discussed related concepts and strategies such as subjectivity, how to look beyond borders and how artists themselves are challenging institutional conventions of the museum.
