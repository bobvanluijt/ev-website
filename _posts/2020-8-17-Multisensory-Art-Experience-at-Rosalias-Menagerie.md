At the cocktailbar and hotel [Rosalia’s Menagerie](https://www.rosalias.amsterdam/) you can indulge yourself in a multisensory art experience. 
Rosalia's Menagerie exhibits in collaboration with curator Eveline Vondeling the work [“Museum of Edible Earth”](http://museumofedible.earth) by Russian artist [Masha Ru](http://masharu.nl/) and Polish artist [Anna Orlikowska’s](http://annaorlikowska.nl) creation “Uh, uhh, mmm”.  

Masha Ru is a creative with the background in science. The projects combine scientific research with a personal approach and cultural practices. The work that we exhibiting is part of a long term project.  Museum of Edible Earth, brings together a collection of edible soils from across the globe. The museum invites the audience to review their knowledge about food and cultural traditions using creative thinking. 

Anna’s practice focuses on site-related works, which stretch the limits of medium of performance, installation, video, sculpture, text and sound. She is translating invisible phenomena into a material, embodied and visible form. Through the generative strategy of translating one medium into another, she is exploring the complex relationship between the ear and the eye and its relatedness to other senses. She is investigating the physicality of sound, its site-specific relation to architecture, its impact on the body and the imagination of the listener.

Dutch curator Eveline Vondeling has selected these works in collaboration with Rosalia’s Menagerie. We aim to give the spectator a new multisensory experience of art, outside of the museum of gallery space and that goes beyond the general gaze and distance we take of art as spectators. For this edition the cocktailbar has designed two cocktails connected to the works. 


Both exhibited works are installed in the hotel rooms of Rosalia's Menagerie and you can explore them until the half od September. 
The price of the cocktails is included in the exhibition ticket.
