Club Sociëteit Sexyland appointed me as the advisor on diversity and inclusivity.  I am very excited to kick off the new year with this new role. Club Sociëteit is a project space located in Amsterdam North. Below I quote their website. 

“For 365 days SEXYLAND has a different owner, every day. The owner of the day decides what kind of club they want it to be, which can vary from art exhibitions to sporting events, from gangster rap nights to dinners in stroboscopic light.
SEXYLAND is a tabula rasa that can be written in any way possible. We want to highlight every unknown corner of Amsterdam, to broadcast the huge diversity this city has to offer. Every day is a new day at SEXYLAND. Feel welcome. 
We are not a dogmatic institute, in the sense that we won’t bring you a complete 365 package to absorb. We believe in the magic that can happen when meeting someone in SEXYLAND by accident, and then coming up with a brilliant idea. There will always be space to realize those gems.
Sociëteit SEXYLAND is an initiative by Eddie the Eagle Museum”.
