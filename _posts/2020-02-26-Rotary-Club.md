The 26th of February I gave a presentation at the [Rotary Club](https://www.rotary.nl/amsterdam/) in Amsterdam. After having breakfast I talked about the multisensory in art, my curatorial practice and upcoming curatorial projects. Afterwards we went to [Stedelijk Museum](https://www.stedelijk.nl/en), where I showed them the sensory artwork 'More Moire' by [Philip Vermeulen](https://philipvermeulen.com/) which was on view for a week in the museum as a part of the [Sonic Arts Festival](https://www.stedelijk.nl/en/events/sonic-acts-academy-2020-2). 

Vermeulen was also present to do a questionary with us, which gave us great insights in his work and upcoming plans.
