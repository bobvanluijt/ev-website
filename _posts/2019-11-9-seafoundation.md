Speaking of multisensority within the arts, I visited the Tilburg (NL) [Seafoundation](https://www.seafoundation.eu) last weekend and experienced the current exhibition [I Presume You Pictured it Differently](https://www.seafoundation.eu/collette_rayner_exhibition/) (18.10.2019-24.11.2019) by the Scottish artist Collette Rayner. 

Looking through the window from the outside, I saw an animated video. The door of the exhibition space is locked; a note on the door asks the visitor to ring the doorbell. The host, an enthusiastic woman, opens the door and hands me a pair of headphones. The drawings carefully hung in and on the white walls of the space, she explains, ‘should be experienced together with the music coming from the headphones’. A low tone, a kind of inner sound coming from a deep cave; the bass brings the viewer to the ground, or lower, it becomes a kind of meditation, where the rhythm of walking through the space becomes slower and where the walls of the exhibition space become smoother. In the rear corner I am intrigued by the artist’s decision to change the wall of the space. The corner is smoothed out by a frame hanging on the left and right wall, creating a space (a triangle) behind the frame. 

The artist, who was born in Dundee, seems to be inspired by nature -- perhaps, I imagined, by having spent time in the caves on the Dundee Falls. As I let my thoughts develop on this subject, I imagined water while walking around in this small space. The line of the animation on the screen, which is placed in the back of the space, gradually sketches the face of a man with glasses. The line, like water, is fluid, appearing and disappearing as if in a loop. I notice that when the sound restarts, the animation restarts as well, making this piece the anchor of the exhibition, so to speak. I wonder whose face this is, which appears and disappears? Why the concentration on the glasses the figure wears? Did the artists want to emphasize ‘seeing’?

Ryner now commutes between Dundee and Rotterdam. In 2018 she finished the Master art program at [Piet Zwart](http://www.pzwart.nl). Her position, somewhere between Dundee Falls and post-war reconstructed Rotterdam, where floating urban architectural projects are no longer science fiction, seems to have brought her to an ‘in between’ position. Trying to construct fictional narratives and attempting to come closer to reality, or perhaps a hyper-reality.
