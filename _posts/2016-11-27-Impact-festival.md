23.–27. November 2016
with: HOOD, RYBN.ORG and FORMATIONS

In November 2016 I was an partcipant at [IMPACT16](https://www.pact-zollverein.de/en/platforms/impact/impact16). I presented my research and collaborated in workshops.

'IMPACT16 is an encounter with HOOD, RYBN.ORG und FORMATIONS, three expert collectives whose diversified forms of cooperation and flexible working practices transcend disciplinary boundaries. How and where do alternative realities come about both in and between different fields of knowledge? How can we productively uncover contradictory ›rift zones‹ in today’s world?

What kind of frameworks for action can we cultivate? Informed by multiple perspectives and practices in the arts, politics, technology, sociology, economics and science, the contributing collectives’ inquiries and strategies circumvent disciplinary limits and constraints and open up new spaces for thought and action.

The transdisciplinary symposium offers 30 participants from broad backgrounds in the arts and science, time and space for in-depth exchanges and interventions as well as experiments in both practice and thought.

IMPACT16 takes place as part of the module ›Techniken des Transfers‹ within the project framework of the Alliance of International Production Houses which enables, for the first time, special conditions of support for participants.

Supported within the framework of the Alliance of International Production Houses by the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media'. Please visit the [website](https://www.pact-zollverein.de/en/platforms/impact/impact16) for more information.
