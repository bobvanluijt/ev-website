For the [Young Collectors Circle](https://youngcollectorscircle.nl) (YCC), I conducted gender- and postcolonial-based research and organised salons related to that topic. As part of this project I collaborated with the art project space [Framer Framed](https://framerframed.nl/en/) (Amsterdam) and [Fotodok](https://www.fotodok.org/en/) (Utrecht) which could be described as an ‘engaged' salon. I developed a full program for members of the YCC to become acquainted with the topic and the ins and outs of collecting engaged art.

The salons that I organised for YCC addressed questions such as the following: how can engaged art make itself visible within the commercial framework? What are existing models for selling engaged art and how are we getting collectors interested in it?
