In 2017 Eveline has worked extensively with the [Transgender Network of the Netherlands](https://www.transgendernetwerk.nl) to create and structure a conceptual framework for the first transgender visibility day in Rotterdam that TNN wanted to organise. The Dutch art magazine [Tubelight](https://www.tubelight.nl) asked Eveline during that time to edit the [102th edition](https://www.tubelight.nl/issue/tl-102/) and include one of her writings related to this topic. 

The edition focused on hapticity as a visual strategy and on how this strategy can be used by the viewer to look at art that focuses on transgender discourse. The edition includes an interview with artist [Chris Rijksen](https://prinschristel.com/contact/ ) interviewed by [Jessica Gysel](https://www.glumagazine.com/about/) (Girls Like Us), reviews of the solo show of artist Evelyn Taocheng Wang and of a ‘tactile’ exhibition at the [Textile Museum in Tilburg (NL)](https://www.textielmuseum.nl/en/). The edition also discusses related concepts and strategies such as subjectivity, how to look beyond borders and how artists themselves are challenging institutional conventions of the museum.
