Together with a team of artists, curators and a psychologist, Forever Changes developed ‘Artists and Curators’, a method for primary schools. The method is applied during a period of approximately five days. During this period of time the children and teachers participate in collaborative workshops enhancing mindfulness, bodily-awareness, and strategic thinking. They also participate in art classes with an emphasis on performance art. The children work towards an exhibition of performances in which they use their own bodies as material. 

On the first day the class gets divided in curators and artists. Each participant chooses his group. We noticed that in a class of for example thirty-five to eight children usually chooses to be curators and the rest would choose to be artists. The groups of artists and curators follow classes together but along the way they also participate in separate workshops. The method Forever Changes applies questions how to work along each other combining different ideas and inputs from each group.  The method is carefully thought through in collaboration with a psychologist ([Nathan Bleijenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-bleijenberg-794906b2/?originalSubdomain=nl) who advised the foundation on methods and ways of interactive play.  Each school is different and we seek together with each school playful ways to work together and find fitting time-frame and the best possibilities to make the project successful for the participants. The teachers are also asked to actively participate and work together with their 	class, to give guidance to their class where necessary.
