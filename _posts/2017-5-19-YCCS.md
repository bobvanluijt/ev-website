On Tuesday 18th April 2017, the [Young Collectors Circle](https://youngcollectorscircle.nl/) hosted an international themed salon at The Hoxton, Amsterdam. Guests included Head of Post War & Contemporary Art at Christie’s, Benthe Tupker, Julia Schleyerbach from the Annet Gelink Gallery, collector and curator Gijs Stork, and artist and Rijksakademie resident Monira Al Qadiri. The discussions of the evening focused on collecting as well as creating and selling art from an international perspective – from the ins and outs of the auction process, to personal stories of collecting art worldwide, to upcoming international art fairs, and the influence of your home country on creating art.
