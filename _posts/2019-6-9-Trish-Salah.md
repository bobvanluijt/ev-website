Thurday June 9th I went to Leiden to participate in a [workshop by Trish Salah](https://graduategenderstudies.nl/workshop-with-trish-salah/). Salah is an assistant Professor of Transnational Studies in Gender, Sexuality, Race and Minority Cultural Production at the Department of Gender Studies, Queen’s University (Kingston, Ontario, Canada). 

Impressed by her poems, Salah helped me to find a way to  start thinking about how to relate to writing or any other ‘cold’ medium with my body. After her workshop I researched her way of writing in depth in relation to video-art theorist Laura Marks who was one of the first to relate haptic visuality to video-art, art historian Alois Riegl by whom Marks is also inspired and postmodern philosophers Deleuze and Guattari. These thinkers all together formed a kind of base for my haptic and multisensory-thinking. 

“To fully experience Trish Salah’s poems asks in my opinion for a more textual-bodily interaction,                      which relies on the haptic, within the smooth. This would mean a close vision of trans poetry as bodies, sentiments and movements on the page. What makes Trish Salah’s poems even more interesting is the fact that she is not only living on the binaries of gender but also between her Father’s Lebanese origin and her Canadian. Therefore she is always living a writing in a space from which to experience and react through bodily enactments of betweenness that entirely disengage from the possibility of stasis (a period or state of inactivity equilibrium, stopping, slowing down) She uses a strategy of appearance and disappearance that becomes an embodied aspect of her poems and her ‘in betweenness’ as for example in her poem [Phoenicia ≠ Lebanon]”
