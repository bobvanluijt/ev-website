In collaboration with artist [Anthony Nestel](https://www.mondriaanfonds.nl/pcprofiel/anthony-nestel/) and choreographer [Esther Arribas](https://estherarribas.com/), the Forever Changes Foundation organised the event ‘No One Thing Alone’. This event was preceded by preparatory reading sessions entitled ‘Always More Than One’. During these reading sessions Nestel and Arribas introduced political philosophical texts from authors including [Erin Manning](http://erinmovement.com/) and [Brian Massumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Massumi) to explore the notion of reading and discussion in pairs.

Nestel and Arribas’ project explored the potentiality of thinking and doing beyond predefined categories, and explored the idea that everything is in process, and goes through change and modification. Each reading group affected the next in an evening full of happenings. There was a lecture by philosopher [Rick Dolphijn](https://www.uu.nl/en/news/rick-dolphijn-appointed-honorary-associate-professor-at-university-of-hong-kong), performances by [Elisa Zuppini](http://dansateliers.nl/en/maker/sigrid-stigsdatter-elisa-zuppini/), DJ Let Go and Nestel and Arribas themselves. The exhibition during the event showed video works by Helena Grande and Nestel and Arribas. The conceptual framework fostered the idea of forming alliances, competing, creating new processes and leaving others behind.

All reading groups and events, as well as the final exhibition, were facilitated by contemporary arts centre de [Appel and urban resort Lely Broedplaats](https://urbanresort.nl/lely/), both situated in Amsterdam.
