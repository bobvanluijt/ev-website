In collaboration with artist [Anthony Nestel](https://www.mondriaanfonds.nl/pcprofiel/anthony-nestel/) and choreographer [Esther Arribas](https://estherarribas.com/), Forever Changes organised the event ‘No One Thing Alone’. This event was preceded by preparatory reading sessions entitled ‘Always More Than One’. During these reading sessions Nestel and Arribas introduced political philosophical texts from [Erin Manning](http://erinmovement.com/) and [Brian Massumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Massumi) among others to explore the notion of reading and discussion in pairs.

Nestel and Arribas’ project explored the potentiality of thinking and doing beyond predefined categories, that everything is in process, and goes through change and modification. Each reading group affecting the next and the event which consisted of an evening full of happenings. There was a lecture by phosphor [Rick Dolphijn](https://www.uu.nl/en/news/rick-dolphijn-appointed-honorary-associate-professor-at-university-of-hong-kong), performances by [Elisa Zuppini](http://dansateliers.nl/en/maker/sigrid-stigsdatter-elisa-zuppini/), DJ Let go and Nestel and Arribas themselves. The exhibition during the event showed the video work of Helena Grande, and Nestel and Arribas. The conceptual framework enhanced the idea of forming alliances, competing, creating new processes and leaving others behind.

All reading groups, events and the final exhibition were facilitated by de [Appel and Lely Broedplaats](https://urbanresort.nl/lely/), both situated in Amsterdam.
