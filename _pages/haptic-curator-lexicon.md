title: Haptic Curator Lexicon

---

In the text below, I try to imagine how a haptic curator moves through the space of the museum and works with the space and artworks. I address art-curation as a potential outgrowth, or a field of application, of haptic criticism. As possible tools elaborate on this initial conceptual framework, I would like to invoke the notion of artworks and the museum space as part of a ‘web’ of materials, the conceptualisation of bodies as flesh, and conceiving of art objects as living entities. These are all notions which can offer curators tools for innovation in the design of exhibitions. This proposed lexicon is an outgrowth of further analysis of and reflection on the initial concepts of ‘assemblage’ and ‘intersectionality’. In this lexicon I imagine my hypothetical show not so much as a distinct use of a segregated space, but rather as part of a web of all the materials present in the museum.

## Art Objects Living Entities

This refers to the change an artwork goes through when the viewer interacts and involves him or
herself with the object of art. The visitor participates in the construction of the work’s meaning. The
artwork therefore is seen as a living, interacting entity embedded in a network of perception (by
visitors and others) and interconnection (with other displayed works, and with the museum space).

**Hypothetical Show:** Guidance for the visitor should be kept subtle and non-intrusive. If there is any
guidance for the viewer, it should be brief explicit. The curator may create structures which require
the viewer to approach the works of art closely (if appropriate) and then distance him or herself
from them. Every change of the artwork in these different circumstances of viewing must be taken
into consideration. All characteristics of the group of spectators must be considered; what are they
wearing? What is the weather like? How tall are they? What is their cultural background and native
language? If possible, there should be no lines (string or wire markings) of separation between
viewer and object. How do the artworks affect relations between visitors? Do they provoke
discussion, or cut it off?

## Being in the Fray

The making, and the undoing of the making, opens up a space to view with a small caressing gaze
which is active and corporeal, embodied. This can be put into practice by exploring traditions that
are themselves based on an initial approach of physical, tactile, haptic intimacy such as embroidery,
weaving, playing a musical instrument, or engaging in sports which make use of objects.

**Hypothetical Show:** Where feasible, the viewer can be allowed to touch the works of art with
different body parts. When the viewer first enters the space in which objects are on display, there is
no light. The experience is initially a bodily one, in which senses such as hearing, smell and touch
navigate the visitor through space without sight. The longer the viewer stays in the space, the more
he sees and the less his body will be involved. Sight functions as a secondary input. This changes
the hierarchical setting of the senses in a manifest and unmistakable intervention. One instructive
example are the immersive installations of artists such as Gregor Schneider, which use cramped,
closed, maze-like environments with dead ends and ‘cold rooms’ to give visitors a direct and
unmediated experience of how space can be used as to impose forms of social control.

## Bodies as Flesh

The body is dematerialised from any objectification and unmoored from all cultural hieroglyphics
(gender and sex, for example). The body as flesh offers different methods for reading through
diverse mediations.

**Hypothetical Show:** The museum space is a space where a diverse group of people traverse the
rooms and spaces. The awareness of categorisation of bodies should be made explicit before
entering this space – but only so that it can later be challenged and deconstructed.

## Body as Direct Presence

The body of the viewer, as a whole, should be treated as of main importance to the art-experience.
The curator should take into consideration the changes the visitor’s body experiences while
traveling through the exhibition. Further, the curator can and should occupy him- or herself with accommodations for gallery visitors with disabilities, acting as a practical advocate within the institutional framework of the museum.

**Hypothetical Show:** The viewer’s body does not wander through the museum space as a passive
entity. Instead, the body is treated as an active participant. The curator can attempt to address the
visitors’ bodies on a direct, pre-verbal level, as with subtle changes in temperature or the acoustic
environment. The visitor can also be granted freedom of movement, allowing him or her to explore
the museum space on their own, and discover unique ways of engaging with the works on display.

## Care

Care for the artist and artworks functions as the foundational principle of the curator’s work. This
principle derives from an intersectional approach which functions as an umbrella of intersecting
issues such as race, gender, class, sexuality and ability. This emphasis on care creates an
autonomous ethical system in which harmful or insensitive institutional policies can be criticised,
and unnecessary limits or restrictions transcended.

**Hypothetical Show:** The exhibition would be primarily conceptualised as an event. Events are based
on variation, change and mediation. Events are never about an individual or singular object, or a
static, always-repeating experience. An event is only an event if there is always more than ‘one’:
plural perspectives, plural experiences. Artists can be invited to join a conversation about how their
work should be displayed in a more collective, communal, and fluid setting.

## Continuous Form

The form of the space in which the curator creates is constantly developed and altered in responsive
ways. The emphasis is on ‘becoming’ rather than on fixed qualities and existing rules. The principle
is based on progress in perception of the artworks, and the continuity between them.

**Hypothetical Show:** The curator emphasises connections between the works. This goes far beyond
mere subject-matter, to encompass unexpected or challenging continuities which emerge naturally
from the juxtaposition of one artwork with another. The artworks function as points of segments,
like traces. The sound between video artworks overlaps if the viewer stands in between the works.
The movement of the viewer’s body may direct the rhythm between the sound of the video
artworks. Installation is not done with a set of rules (one sound louder than the other, walls
separating works) but the installation is perceived as a ‘work in progress’ which is continuously
being ‘remade’. This means the curator creates with the material (artworks) that he or she is given.
The materials in this show are not treated on the basis of their ‘outcomes’, such as the exhibition,
the conference, the catalogue etc. Rather, they are connected to each other on the communal level of
process. Chance reflections, contrasts, or overlaps which emerge precisely because of the
juxtaposition of the works can be exploited, in an ongoing process, to explore and deepen
relationships between the works.

## Flesh

Erotic and desirable, flesh is conceived of as being uncoupled from the body and thus unwritten and
‘blank’ which allows flesh to respond in a profoundly intimate way, drawing on interlocking details.
This conception of flesh reflects resistance to any discourse and asks the viewer to come close to the
artwork as an embodied thing, and experience it in a more intimate fashion.

**Hypothetical Show:** Curation can become a kind of pathfinding during the act of curating/making.
Curating can become a guidepost to new ways of seeing and feeling.

## Handmade

Moving away from high cultural forms of making towards the ‘low cultural forms of making’ that
are an invitation of touch. Such as; gardening, embroidery, knitting, or cooking for example. Many
contemporary artists have begun to explore these more traditionally humble forms of creation as a
way of questioning the boundary between ‘high’ and ‘folk’ or ‘outsider’ art.

**Hypothetical Show:** The curator may include artworks that make use of, or are based on, these
cultural forms of making that move away from optical vision. The curator could also include
information about the practical details of how certain artworks (textile, painting, or sculpture) are
created. This may serve to ‘disenchant’ the idea of the artwork as especially valuable because of its
unique, non-interchangeable, and ‘handmade’ quality: in fact, people are constantly creating
artefacts with exactly these properties worldwide. The emphasis on handmade things and activities
drawn from the needs of everyday life can include a participatory component.

## Haptic Visuality

Haptic visuality is a strategy within the artistic realm, it is a close vision that does not draw upon
distant vision or a clear separation between what is viewed (on the screen) and who is viewing
(standing in front of the screen). Haptic visuality is about tactility, touch, and embodiment between
the artwork and viewer.

**Hypothetical Show:** Including artworks that make use of this strategy.

## Intensities

An exhibition might include elements that unsettle and are unpredictable, or which change and flow,
responding to factors not traditionally considered relevant to the museum experience, such as
temperature, weather, or ambient noise.

**Hypothetical Show:** The weather can be allowed ‘into’ the museum space, to interact with and
change the intensity of the light and sound environment of the gallery. The exhibition space can be
constantly subtly changed to according to prevailing weather conditions. Visitors can be encouraged
to discover for themselves how transitory elements such as weather, traditionally considered a
distraction, can instead be viewed as components of how the artwork itself is experienced.

## Limitations of the Striated

This concept implies a critique of the traditional conception of Western museum space as a space
which limits the capacity of a body. The imposition of clean, flat walls and strictly segregated
spaces is considered, at most, as a necessary evil. Even when they cannot be altered, the structure of
the exhibition can at least encourage the visitor to become aware of their limitations, and the
limitations they impose on visitors, museum staff, and artists.

**Hypothetical Show:** The curator might treat the walls, ceiling and floor as limitations of continuity
of the experience. The curator should think carefully about how many walls and separations need to
exist within the museum space, and should be open to the possibilities created by allowing a
Deleuzian ‘multiplicity’ of forms to flourish within a more ‘smooth’ non-hierarchical spatial
organization.

## Rhizomatic Continuity

The exhibition emphasises the interconnection of the artworks in a self-chosen order and their
interpretation within the conceptual frame of the curator. The viewer is asked to make or find
connections, with only limited guidance from the curator. This approach turns the viewer into an
active adaptive participant instead of a passive object or passenger.

**Hypothetical Show:** The exhibition might contain no other walls than the walls that hold the striated
space. The notion of the rhizome encompasses the notion of multiplicity, of a scattered distribution
of meaning, and multiple entry and exit points. Works of art could be arranged in way that make
them seem to ‘sprout up’ at seemingly random points or in configurations reminiscent of nature.
They can also be arranged in ways that highlight a subtle conceptual interdependence and
development among them, while always leaving the visitor to draw any ultimate conclusions about
the nature of their relationships.

## Web of Materials

The curator/middlemen/mediator employs a haptic mode of perception which posits that art objects
are alive and, like living things, are subject to a process of constant change as a result of being a
part of a web of materials and of being a part of active bodies (bodies as flesh, dematerialised and
thus free from any objectification).

**Hypothetical Show:** The strategy of variation which is always plural and never static. There is no hierarchy and no singularity. The model is not so much a disciplined space as a ‘rhizomatic’ organic profusion, not imposed from above, but following its own internal logic. Exhibition strategies which permit change and adaptation are favoured; the exhibition is undergoing a constant, subtle process of reevaluation and change which is guided by the new forms and connections which have emerged as the result of the interplay between the various works.
