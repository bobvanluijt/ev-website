*Forever Changes, Foundation for Participatory Art* offers as a platform for people of different backgrounds, origins and disciplines to meet and develop interpersonal relationships and create artistic methods to work with the public. I established this foundation in 2015, and today I work as a curator for the initiated projects.

The foundation allows emerging professionals to elaborate methods which can be used to elicit a response from the public and impact the space in which the method is applied. The impact Forever Changes seeks is to make the public question the current mode of living and the role of art in today’s society. In other words Forever Changes aims to foster the public’s involvement in its own environment, providing a starting point for the public to begin the process of creating a composition. As the public interacts within the framework of the method, its actions give rise to artistic expression. The material is the public itself. Through this form and this material, the composition is created. Forever Changes, thus, investigates the possibility for collective attitudes - attitudes which reveal aspects of both the individual’s and the public’s identity.
