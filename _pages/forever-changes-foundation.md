*Forever Changes, foundation for participatory art* functions as a platform where people of different backgrounds, origins and disciplines unite to develop interpersonal relationships and create artistic methods to work with the public. I established this foundation in 2015, and today I work as a curator for the initiated projects. 

The foundation allows emerging professionals to elaborate methods which can be used to elicit a response from the public and impact the space in which the method is applied. The impact Forever Changes seeks is to make the public question the current mode of living and the role of art in today’s society. In other words Forever Changes activates the public’s involvement in its own environment. The method for doing so is only a starting point for the public to begin the process of creating a composition. As the public acts according to the method, its actions give rise to an artistic form of expression. The material is the public itself. Through this form and this material, the composition is created. Thus Forever Changes investigates the possibility for collective attitudes-attitudes which reveal aspects of both the individual’s and the public’s identity.
