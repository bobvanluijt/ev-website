Eveline Vondeling trained as an artist at the [Rietveld Art academy](https://rietveldacademie.nl/) and exhibited internationally before turning to writing and curatorial practice. She holds a Master's Degree in Arts and Culture with a focus on Gender and Ethnicity from the University of Utrecht. Her research focuses on multisensority as a curatorial practice, and examines the act of curating as an artistic practice.

In 2013 she was awarded at the [International Public Art Triennial, Emscher Kunst for a collaborative architectural project](https://detlefsnotizblog.blogspot.com/2013/07/emscherkunst2013-europaisches.html) exhibited at the Duisburg Emscher Kunst biennale. Her writings have been published by Tubelight Magazine (NL) and Publishing House Clinamen (CH).

Recently she has worked together with the Transgender Network of the Netherlands for the visibility art exhibition and she has worked for the Young Collectors Circle (NL).
